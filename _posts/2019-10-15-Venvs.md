title: python3 virtual env aliases
toc: true
toc_label: "py3 venv aliases"

So I recently transitioned from using conda environments to python virtual environments. They're pretty similar but I've written a couple scripts to make things easier for myself.

### Installation steps/notes:
1. If you're on a mac you have to install python 3 because they still come with python 2 for some reason... https://pythonclock.org/
    - No included package manager? Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
    - `brew install python3`
    - `pip3 install virtualenv`
2. I prefer to keep all my venvs in one location `~/envs/`
    - `mkdir envs`
    - `cd envs`
    - `virtualenv whatever_venv_name_you_want`
3. Add a script to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to make activation aliases
    - This script makes activate_venv_name an alias that points to the correct bash command for all envs in `~/envs/`
```
for D in ~/envs/*/
do
    D="${D%"${D##*[!/]}"}"
    N="${D##*/}"
    alias activate_$N="source $D/bin/activate"
done
```
