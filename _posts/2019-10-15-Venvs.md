title: python3 virtual env aliases

So I recently transitioned from using conda environments to python virtual environments. They're pretty similar but I've written a couple scripts to make things easier for myself.

### Installation steps/notes:
1. If you're on a mac you have to install python 3 because they still come with [python 2](https://pythonclock.org/) for some reason... 
    - No included package manager? Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh)
    - `brew install python3`
2. I prefer to keep all my venvs in one location `~/envs/`
    - `mkdir envs`
    - `cd envs`
    - `python3 -m venv whatever_venv_name_you_want`
3. Add a script to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to make activation aliases
    - This script makes activate-name_of_venv an alias that points to the correct bash command for all envs in `~/envs/`
```
for D in ~/envs/*/
do
    D="${D%"${D##*[!/]}"}"
    N="${D##*/}"
    alias activate-$N="source $D/bin/activate"
done
```
    - `source .bashrc` or restart your terminal
4. Install ipykernel for jupyter hub or notebooks
    - `activate-name_of_venv`
    - `pip install ipykernel`
    - `python -m ipykernel install --user --name name_of_venv --display-name "name_of_venv"`
