Hey everyone, welcome to my site which will serve to document my goals, projects, thoughts and whatever else might happen to need to get documented.

I've never really done new years resolutions before and decided on a whim (after watching some cool Youtube video about how people automate their daily routines) that I should start making some changes... by which I mean track what I do and figure out my stats (and eventually set goals for myself).

This first post is to document what I plan to work on and what the goals for 2018Q1 are.

I'll be cleaning this up (in the code) and updating this page as I make progress.

Goal | Description
---|---
Get Healthy | Diet, sleep hygiene, supplements, nootropics, doctor visits
Get Scheduled | Strict scheduling of time, regular sleep and work hours
Get Rich | Machine learning augmented crypto or stock day-trading
Get Fit | Strength, BMI, Endurance
Get Focused | Meditate
Get Deeper | Practice more deep/machine learning
Get Responsive | Respond to messages faster
Get Organized | Goals, planning, realistic constraints, completion, time management
Get Handsome | Hair, Hygiene, Style
Get Internet Famous | Blogger, twitter
Get Creative | Painting, music, sculpting, art creation
Get Politically Active |	Activism via machine learning
